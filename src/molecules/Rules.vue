    <h1>Please follow our rules</h1>
    <p class="guestbook-descriptor">
      We live in a quiet neighborhood right off the intercoastal, and people move here for the one-of-a-kind peace it affords.

      We want you to have fun during your stay, but please consider our neighbors while enjoying our property.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p>
      - Please try to keep the noise down after 10pm. Enjoy the pool and outside area while respecting our neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      - If something breaks, please let us know right away. We understand these things happen, we just want to get the house ready for our next guests!
    </p>
    <p>
      - Respect our check-out time. If you ask us for more time ahead of time we will try to accomodate you, but it is dependent on our cleaner's schedules.
